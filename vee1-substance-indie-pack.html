                            <p>Allegorithmic is the developer of Substance, the killer app when it comes to texturing So you can buy the full Indie pack, or purchase software you are missing individually at the same price as buying the Indie Pack. If you purchase all 3 software, Substance Designer, Substance Painter and B2M, you can also get the 30 PBR Substances as detailed in the Indie. The Site Licensing includes access to X number of Education Packs (includes Substance Painter, Substance Designer and Substance B2M) and a Campus access to Substance Source with a year of updates. Yearly renewal of the Site Licensing is not mandatory and costs 70% of the price of the Site Licensing. i mean it is in my gift inventory. the icon tells is the substance painter not the substance indie pack. ok an image worth more than thousand words. if i click in "view in store" send me to steam's main store page not the related product's page thx for your quick response Cheers. 
I am worried because you have discounted a good pack but I have bought Substance Painter and now I am afraid that I will have to pay much more to get a neat bonus With the Indie pack, substance designer, substance painter and B2M are all separate applications. They are not DLC and designer is not required to run any of the programs. For the sale, it is 4.99 USD - as a pack and .49 for Substance Painter individual. Substance Designer is not on sale, but its .00 Cheers Bought the Substance Indie pack a couple of months ago, and i love it. Very usable programs that can really help to create great looking textures/substances, and then use them (substances) in Substance painter on your models. The indie pack allows you to use all the tools for commercial work unless you earn over 000 and also has limits on how you can distribute the substance files you create. For example you aren't allowed to sell substance files and you can't use the batch tools for generating substances you have to create each substance manually. Игровой портал Gameru.net.
